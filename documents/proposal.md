Wrix

Holding a clothes swap? We can help.

My course project will be a website that helps users plan their clothes swap events. (The name comes from the term "wrixle," which means to exchange opinions or share thoughts. In this case, it's also the opportunity to exchange pre-owned clothes at a coordinated event called a clothes swap.) The site will offer helpful tips and resources for planning a successful event, along with photos of past events that may provide inspiration. I want to use an API that allows guests to RSVP for the event, similar to The Knot for wedding planning, or Evite. I want to build this site because last year I hosted my first clothes swap event. Not only was it a great opportunity to get many of my friends together in a fun and encouraging atmosphere, but it also inspired us to tidy up our closets, get rid of stuff we don't use any more, and of course bring home new-to-us clothes for free. As a bonus, all clothing that was not taken home by someone at the event was donated to a local shelter for those who could use it most. I realized after holding this event that there were so many ways to do it, and all of them are fun, memorable, and benefit the environment and community. With the creation of Wrix, more people would host these events.
